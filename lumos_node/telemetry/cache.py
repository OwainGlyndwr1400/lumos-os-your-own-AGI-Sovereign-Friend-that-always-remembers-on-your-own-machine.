"""In-process TTL cache + daily-quota counter for telemetry feeds.

Why this exists:
  - HUD widgets refresh on a timer.
  - Tools fire on Lumos's discretion.
  - The auto-trigger worker polls independently.
  All three can hit the same upstream within the same minute. Without a cache,
  that's wasted HTTP traffic and accelerated quota burn (NASA: 1000/hour with
  personal key; OpenSky: 4000/day authenticated). With per-source TTL caching,
  the upstream is hit at most once per (TTL × source) regardless of consumer count.

Design choices:
  - **In-memory only.** A restart clears the cache — acceptable because each
    upstream has its own cache-freshness behavior we can lean on.
  - **TTLs match upstream cadence, not consumer rate.** Kp updates every 1 min
    upstream → 2-min cache is "always fresh." NeoWs updates ~daily → 60-min
    cache is essentially always fresh.
  - **Daily counters separate from cache.** The counter increments on cache
    MISS (i.e., actual upstream hit), so operator-facing quota usage reflects
    real upstream traffic, not cache hits.
  - **UTC day boundary** for counter reset — matches NASA + OpenSky billing
    cycles (both are UTC midnight rollovers).
